function f is sum of 3 indicators
Update the function (ODE) to what it means in the paper
Use the data of different experiments (treated and untreated cells)
Explain different experiments at once

Find out the point of time rather than the peek concentration
The peek is very clear in one of the experimental conditions

change ODE system to the paper
easily change the experimental conditions

Supplement matirial mathe code
4.17 in quasi steady state, slow process in dynamical process, the slow process can be seen as already realized

Not to hard code fix code parameters, fix through variable

switch between log scale and fixed scale
introduce
use a dict for the ODE



Change ODE
make adjustable for time point, (run the simulation long enough and just take the max 2 points) Idee
maybe store the integration value at each point
